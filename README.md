## Overview
- Context: Brazil has over +500 congresspeople and +25 political parties. Corruption is a huge problem and the system is known for its bad incentives. There already are civil initiatives to evaluate political performance (Ranking dos Pol√≠ticos), but it lacks people engagement.
- Goal: Leverage Brazilian people politics knowledge and help to improve marginally the system accountability.
- Idea: a 100% digital stickers album where the stickers are Brazilian politicians.

## How does it work (features)
- Album: each user has an album copy with +500 empty stickers. Your goal is to find it all.
- Stickers: Stickers come in packs of 5 random stickers. When you sign up you earn 40 free packs. Each 20 minutes you can take 2 free packs. It is harder to get stickers of good politicians.
- Exchange Stickers: You can exchange repeated stickers with friends and other users.
- Knowledge: Cards have basic info and you can see more stats by clicking on it. Stats source are Ranking dos Pol√≠ticos.
- Play (not implemented): You can play games to test your cards strengths and your political knowledge to earn new packs.
